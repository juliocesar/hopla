        Hopla
      </h1>
      <p>
        Hopla is not a utility belt. It's forged with the blood of a thousand enemies,
        and delivers deadly efficiency in trained hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hopla runs as a Rake task. You can customise it, like the warrior-programmer
        you are. There are no hidden layers or anything of the sort. Read the source,
        and you'll understand what it does.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get Hopla, run:
      </p>
      <pre><code>$ wget https://raw.github.com/juliocesar/hopla.io/master/Rakefile</code></pre>
      <p>
        Then run the following command and follow the instructions:
      </p>
      <pre><code>$ rake hopla</code></pre>
      <p>
        Hopla will output what it compiles in <code>assets/</code>
        into the <code>public/</code> directory. It features a built-in
        web server for use in development, but deploy as you see fit
        for real combat.
      </p>

        Hopla was forged with the fury of a thousand suns by
        <a href="https://twitter.com/julio_ody">Julio</a>, and lives in
        <a href="https://github.com/juliocesar/hopla.io">GitHub</a>.
